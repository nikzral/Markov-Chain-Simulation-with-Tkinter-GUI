# Markov-Chain-Simulation-with-Tkinter-GUI
This Python program simulates a Markov chain and provides a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter for visualization. The Markov chain is defined with states ('Burger', 'Pizza', 'Hotdogs') and a transition probability matrix. The GUI displays the states on a canvas, updating in real-time as the Markov chain is simulated.
